## Developing Locally

| Prerequisites                                                                |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.14+.                                      |
| (optional) [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node version management. |

1. Clone this repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

2. For the starter to have full functionality locally (e.g. edge functions, blob store), please ensure you have an up-to-date version of Netlify CLI. Run:

```
npm install netlify-cli@latest -g
```

3. Link your local repository to the deployed Netlify site. This will ensure you're using the same runtime version for both local development and your deployed site.

```
netlify link
```

4. Then, run the Astro.js development server via Netlify CLI:

```
netlify dev
```

If your browser doesn't navigate to the site automatically, visit [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).
